This is a rewrite of MovieNamer after it became too unwieldy to work with
anymore. I will slowly Migrate features from MovieNamer into MovieNamer2
and also include various enhancements.

# Installation #
MovieNamer2 requires Python and themoviedb to run.
Install themoviedb from [here](https://github.com/doganaydin/themoviedb).
Then run

	./movienamer2 --help
