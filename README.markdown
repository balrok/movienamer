This is a rewrite of MovieRenamer after it became too unwieldy to work with 
anymore. I will slowly Migrate features from MovieRenamer into MovieRenamer2
and also include various enhancements.

# Installation #
MovieRenamer2 requires Python and themoviedb to run.
Get themoviedb from [here](https://github.com/doganaydin/themoviedb) 
then run ./movierenamer2 --help
